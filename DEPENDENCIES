This package links against 'idanlib' which is available from https://github.com/00shoham/idanlib.
Check that package for its own dependencies - principally developer libraries for lua and curl.

The package was developed on Ubuntu, but should be readily portable to any POSIX-based system, and
certainly to any other Linux distribution with minimal trouble.

The web services provided in auth2cookie were tested under Apache2, but any standards-compliant
web server should be usable.
