Auth2Cookie - INSTALLATION
===========================================================================

First, download and build idanlib from https://github.com/00shoham/idanlib
Nothing will work until that's ready.

Next, build and install the package by opening a shell prompt, using 'cd'
to enter the src/ folder and typing:

  make

If that didn't work, you may not have a compiler or another pre-requisite.
Figure out your dependencies.

You have to configure Apache2 to enable CGIs:

  sudo bash
  cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
  ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/cgi.load .

A minimal configuration in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled looks like this:

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /data/www/
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /data/cgi-bin/
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
    <Directory "/data/cgi-bin">
      AllowOverride None
      Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
      Require all granted
    </Directory>
    <Directory "/data/www">
      AllowOverride None
      Options -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
      Require all granted
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>

Note that in the above example, CGI programs will go in /data/cgi-bin
and static web content will go in /data/www.  Adjust these paths to suit
your needs.  You will need to restart Apache2 to load your configuration:

  sudo bash
  /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
  /etc/init.d/apache2 start
  tail /var/log/syslog

  (see if it worked)

  Open a web browser to http://localhost/ or whatever to see if you can see anything.

  Don't bother testing auth2cookie until your web server works....

Once you have Apache2 configured:

  cd auth2cookie/src

  << EDIT INSTALL-WEB.SH TO REFLECT YOUR LOCAL DIRECTORIES AND URLS >>

  ./install-web.sh

  (enter your password to run some commands as root, as required).

You should now be able to browse to something like:

  http://localhost/cgi-bin/auth2cookie

Don't worry if it complains about missing parameters - getting any response at
all is all you want at this stage.  You want an app to redirect a user to
auth2cookie via a call to ExtractUserIDOrDieEx() to use it properly.  Try:

  http://localhost/cgi-bin/test-cgi

That's it - it is installed.
